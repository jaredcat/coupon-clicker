Claims the daily bonus "Lucky Pot" for you automatically.
This adds up to being pretty significant over time.

## Tips

Recommend: running this about an hour before the reset for each day at 12:00 AM GMT

Install on a Windows machine that you can leave on all the time. I have this on a VM on my server.
When you can, enable `Content Delivery` as this earns even more (this feature is not available linux)

You're limited to 1 machine per IP, but can also install it on your phone. The mobile app has various settings you can configure if you have a limited dataplan or dont want it to drain your battery.

## About

> Start earning with Honeygain, and use the money to pay for a streaming platform subscription, unlock exclusive content on free-to-play video games, or simply treat yourself with a little online shopping spree. After all, you’ll earn free money with Honeygain!

Basically, you install Honeygain desktop app on your computer (Windows perferably) and they use your internet connection for VPN node. Similar to Tor. I have read this can have some risks but I have had no issues myself and have plenty of extra bandwidth to share. I earn about $20 every 2-3 months for doing nothing.
