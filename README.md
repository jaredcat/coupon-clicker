## Info

### Vons.com

Vons has a captcha page when when signing in. You will need to sign up for [2captcha](https://2captcha.com/?from=17648232) and add a few dollars to your account and add your token to your `config.js`.
Each login will use about $0.01 so you don't need much.

### Target.com

To maximize your discounts sign up for a [RedCard](https://goto.target.com/YP0PJ)\
This gives you **permanent 5%** (plus another 5% on your birthday) off. I recommend getting the debit card to avoid the hassle of having another credit card.

- Target also only allows you to save 60 deals at a time.
  - Because of this, offers are sorted by "Trending".
